# Netflix Home page design using HTML and CSS

An effort to create Netflix home page by just using HTML and CSS.

I have tried to use [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) CSS naming convention here. Might not be best but I found there is some usefulness of the convention.

# Limitation

The code is not responsive yet. I have planned to add in coming days.
Its in my `#TODO` list.

## Enjoy!!
